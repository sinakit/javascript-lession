## Javascript code for server side!!
- [ ] what is Js?
JS or JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used for web development. It is a versatile language that allows developers to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. JavaScript can be used for tasks such as validating form inputs, creating interactive content, handling events, making HTTP requests, and manipulating HTML elements on web pages. It is supported by all major web browsers and can be used on both the client-side (in the browser) and the server-side (with the help of server-side frameworks like Node.js). JavaScript is known for its flexibility and wide range of libraries and frameworks that make web development more efficient and powerful.
- [ ] Js convention
Snake case:
Snake case Separates each word with an underscore (_).
Kebab Case:
In case we want to write a name, we have to put underscore. But if we can not put, but our work does not look pretty.
The difference between snake case and kebab case is that kebab case separates each word with a dash character, -, instead of an underscore.
Camel Case:
When using the camel case, you start by creating the first lowercase letter. You then capitalize the first letter of each word below.
 Pascal Case:
 The only difference between the two words is that the pascal case requires that the first letter of the first word be capitalized as well.

- [ ] How to use variable? Declare and Use
Declaration:
To declare a variable, you use the var, let, or const keyword, followed by the variable name.
var: This keyword was traditionally used to declare variables in JavaScript. It has function scope or global scope, depending on where it is declared.
var myVariable;
let: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), let allows you to declare block-scoped variables. Block scope means that the variable is limited to the block ({}) where it is declared or any nested blocks.
let myVariable;
const: Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare variables that are constants. The value assigned to a const variable cannot be changed once it is assigned. const also has block scope.
const myVariable;
const: Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare variables that are constants. The value assigned to a const variable cannot be changed once it is assigned. const also has block scope.
